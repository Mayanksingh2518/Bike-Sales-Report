# Bike Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing bike sales data. The dataset contains various attributes related to customers and their purchasing behavior. A pivot table and a dashboard were created to visualize and derive insights from the data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

1. **ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
2. **Marital Status**: Marital status of the customer.
3. **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
4. **Income**: Annual income of the customer.
5. **Children**: Number of children the customer has.
6. **Education**: Education level of the customer.
7. **Occupation**: Occupation of the customer.
8. **Home Owner**: Indicates if the customer owns a home.
9. **Cars**: Number of cars owned by the customer.
10. **Commute Distance**: Distance the customer commutes to work.
11. **Region**: Geographic region where the customer lives.
12. **Age**: Age of the customer.
13. **Purchased Bike**: Indicates if the customer purchased a bike (Yes/No).

## Pivot Table
A pivot table was created to summarize and analyze the data. Key metrics and dimensions used in the pivot table include:

- **Rows**:
  - Marital Status
  - Gender
  - Region

- **Columns**:
  - Purchased Bike

- **Values**:
  - Count of ID (to get the number of customers)
  - Sum of Income (to get the total income of customers)
  - Average Age (to get the average age of customers)

The pivot table helps in understanding the distribution and trends in bike purchases across different demographics and regions.

## Dashboard
A dashboard was created to visualize the insights derived from the dataset and the pivot table. Key components of the dashboard include:

1. **Sales by Marital Status and Gender**: A bar chart showing bike purchases segmented by marital status and gender.
2. **Income Distribution**: A histogram displaying the distribution of income among customers.
3. **Bike Purchases by Region**: A map showing the number of bikes purchased in different regions.
4. **Average Age of Bike Purchasers**: A gauge chart indicating the average age of customers who purchased bikes.
5. **Cars Owned vs. Bike Purchases**: A scatter plot showing the relationship between the number of cars owned and bike purchases.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the bike sales data, highlighting key patterns and insights.

## How to Use
1. **Dataset**: Load the provided dataset into your preferred data analysis tool (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, Power BI, Tableau).
2. **Pivot Table**: Create a pivot table using the specified rows, columns, and values to analyze the data.
3. **Dashboard**: Use the pivot table data to create visualizations and build the dashboard. Customize the visuals as needed to highlight key insights.

## Conclusion
This project provides a detailed analysis of bike sales data, using pivot tables and dashboards to uncover trends and patterns. The insights derived can help in making data-driven decisions for marketing, sales strategies, and customer targeting.
